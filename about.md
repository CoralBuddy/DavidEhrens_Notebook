Hello! Welcome to my open lab notebook. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science in the [Cnidarian Immunity Laboratory](https://www.cnidimmunitylab.com/). My research aims to use various bulk and single cell molecular approaches to understand how marine organisms will respond to future climate change stressors. I believe that an open-source approach to integrative research will increase productivity and progress in the scientific field. If you have questions about my research or have suggestions for improvement, please contact me at [kevinhwong1@gmail.com](mailto:kevinhwong1@gmail.com).
