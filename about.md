I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Rhode Island in the Putnam Laboratory. My research aims to determine the mechanisms behind intra-generational and trans-generational acclimatization of reef-building corals in response to environmental change. I believe that an open-source approach to integrative research will increase productivity and progress in the scientific field. If you have questions about my research or have suggestions for improvement, please contact me at [kevinhwong1@gmail.com](mailto:kevinhwong1@gmail.com).
