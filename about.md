Hello! Welcome to my open lab notebook. I am a PhD student Researcher at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science in the [Cnidarian Immunity Laboratory](https://www.cnidimmunitylab.com/). My research is focused on coral stem cell research. If you have questions about my research or have suggestions for improvement, please contact me at [david.ehrens@earth.miami.edu](mailto:david.ehrens@earth.miami.edu).
