The goal of this protocol is to airbrush and homogenize adult P. astreoides fragments with PBS from the Porites Nutrition June 2019 project.

## Protocol

1. Sample corals for metabolomics
  * Approximately 0.5cm chip in duplicates
  * 2 tubes and placed immediately back into the -80Â°C
2. Airbrush coral with ice cold PBS (pH 7.4)
  * Following [this protocol](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral_Tissue_Removal_protocol/)
3. Record volume
4. Homogenize on ice with a standing rotor homogenizer
5. Aliquot duplicates of 0.5mL per metric
  * Chl, zoox, protein, CS, TAC
  * Place in freezer
6. Sterilize homogenizer and clippers
  * 10% Bleach, DI water wash 1, DI water wash 2, 70% Ethanol
7. Place the skeleton in bleach for 24 hours, label, and quantify surface area.
