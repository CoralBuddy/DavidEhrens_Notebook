### Goal
To stream line the protocol for DNA/RNA extractions for *Porites astreoides* LARVAE

### Samples

Today I am using 6 larval *P. astreoides* samples that were snap frozen in the field. Each vial has 20 larvae. 3 were from the Thermal Transplant experiment in 2018 and 3 were from the Porites Nutrition experiment in 2019.

| Vial 	| Sample Type 	| Experiment                	| Coral ID 	|
|------	|-------------	|---------------------------	|----------	|
| 12   	| Larvae      	| Porites Nutrition (2019)  	| P-35     	|
| 27   	| Larvae      	| Porites Nutrition (2019)  	| P-20     	|
| 161  	| Larvae      	| Porites Nutrition (2019)  	| P-6      	|
| 550  	| Larvae      	| Thermal Transplant (2018) 	| R-11-A   	|
| 1053 	| Larvae      	| Thermal Transplant (2018) 	| P-12-A   	|
| 1257 	| Larvae      	| Thermal Transplant (2018) 	| P-19-A   	|

### Protocol description
I used a modified version of [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-extractions-Porites-Thermal-Transplant-Larvae-BATCH-1/) with the addition of bead beating.

### Sample Preparation and Digestion
1. Take samples out from -80 &deg;C.
2. Immediately add 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield.
3. Add 0.25 μl glass beads (0.5mm) into each sample.
4. Vortex at max speed for 30 seconds.
5. Remove 400 μl of the supernatant and transfer to a new tube.
6. Add 40 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 20 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to each sample.
7. Vortex and spin down.
8. Add 460 μl of lysis buffer.
9. Continue with DNA and RNA extraction protocol

### Quantify Results

### Qubit
To test DNA quantity: [Qubit](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Qubit-Protocol.md)  

I used DNA and RNA broad range.

|            	| DNA (ng/uL) 	| RNA (ng/uL) 	|
|------------	|-------------	|-------------	|
| Standard 1 	| 164.58      	| 372.85      	|
| Standard 2 	| 17530.71    	| 8876.50     	|
| 12         	| 13.7        	| 34.0        	|
| 27         	| 35.8        	| 46.2        	|
| 161        	| 48.4        	| 48.8        	|
| 550        	| 34.8        	| 54.6        	|
| 1053       	| 39.8        	| 40.4        	|
| 1257       	| 45.4        	| 57.4        	|
