This protocol is to quantify SAM (S-Adenosylmethionine) quantities in *Astrangia poculata*. I used the [SAM ELISA KIT from BioVision](https://www.biovision.com/s-adenosylmethionine-sam-elisa-kit.html). A modified version of the [kit protocol](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/images/SAM_Kit_Assay.pdf) was used. Only 1-96 well plate is provided with this kit, therefore only 40 samples can be measured with 8 standards and duplicates. The following table shows the 39 samples selected for this analyses (based off a range of coloration in each treatment):

# Equipment and Reagents needed
* [SAM ELISA Kit](https://www.biovision.com/s-adenosylmethionine-sam-elisa-kit.html)
* [Protease Inhibitor Cocktail](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/78430)
* Centrifuge
* Incubator (37°C)

# Reagent Preparation
* **Biotin detection antibody working solution**
  * 96 wells x 0.05 mL = 4.8 mL --> 5 mL
  * Dilute Biotin Antibody with Antibody-dilution buffer at 1:100
  * 0.05 mL Biotin Antibody + 4.95 mL Antibody-dilution buffer
* **HRP-Streptavidin Conjugate (SABC) working solution**
  * 96 wells x 0.1 mL = 9.6 mL --> 10 mL
  * Dilute SABC with SABC dilution buffer at 1:100
  * 0.1 mL SABC + 9.9 mL SABC dilution buffer
* **Wash Buffer**
  * Dilute 30 mL of Wash buffer in 720 mL of DI water for a total of 750 mL
  * Incubate at 40°C to dissolve any remaining crystals
  * Cool to room temperature before use
* **Standard Preparation**
  * Reconstitute lyophilized SAM standard by adding 1 mL of Standard/Sample dilution buffer to the vial. This concentration will be 25 ug/mL. Use within 2 hours of reconstituting
  * Allow solution to sit at room temperature of for 10 minutes, the gently vortex
  * Perform a series of serial dilutions to create the following range of standard concentrations in Table 3.
    * e.g. To prepare 0.6 mL of ug/mL standard (S2), add 0.3 of the stock solution (S1) with 0.3 mL of Standard/Sample dilution buffer.
    * S8 will be 300 uL of Standard/Sample dilution buffer

# Sample Preparation

1. Thaw homogenate samples from -80°C
2. Separate host from symbionts
  * Centrifuge samples at 6000g for 2 mins at 4°C
  * Remove 400 uL of supernatant and transfer to a new tube
3. Add protease inhibitor cocktail
  * Since samples at 400 uL, 4 uL of protease inhibitor cocktail was added
  * Vortex to mix
4. Lyse cells with multiple freeze thaw cycles
  * Place samples in -80°C for 5 minutes, the move directly into the thermocycler for at 37°C for 5 minutes. Repeat 5 times.
5. Centrifuge to remove debris
  * Centrifuge at 5000g for 5 minutes

# Assay Protocol

1. Bring all reagents, standards, and samples to room temperature for 30 minutes
2. Wash plate 2 times with **1 X Wash Solution** before adding standard, sample, and control wells
3. Add 50 uL of each standard or sample into appropriate wells
  * Immediately add 50 uL of **Biotin-detection antibody** working solution to each well
  * Cover with the Plate sealer provided
  * Gently tap to ensure wells are mixed
  * Incubate for __45 minutes__ at 37°C
4. Discard the solution and wash 3 times with **1 X Wash Solution**.
  * Wash by filling each well with 350 uL of Wash Buffer using a multichannel pipette. Let it soak for __1-2 minutes__, and then remove all residual wash-liquid from the wells by aspiration.
  * After the last wash, remove any remaining Wash Buffer by aspirating or decanting. Clap the plate on absorbent filter papers or other absorbent materials.
5. Add 100 uL of **SABC working solution** into each well. cover the plate and incubate at 37°C for __30 minutes__.
6. Discard the solution and wash 5 times with **1 X Wash Solution** as Step 4.
7. Add 90 uL of **TMB substrate** into each well, cover the plate and incubate at 37°C in the dark for __15-30 minutes__. The shades of blue should be seen in the first 3-4 wells by the end of the incubation.
8. add 50 uL of the **stop solution** to each well. Read result at 450 nm within 20 minutes.
