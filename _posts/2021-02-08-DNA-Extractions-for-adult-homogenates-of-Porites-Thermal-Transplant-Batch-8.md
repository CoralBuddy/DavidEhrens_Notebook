DNA extractions for Porites Thermal Transplant ADULTS BATCH #8

### Goal
To process DNA for *Porites astreoides* adult homogenates for the Thermal Transplant 2018 experiment using [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-Extractions-for-adult-homogenates-of-Porites-Thermal-Transplant/).I am re-extracting 3 samples that had low quality.

### Samples

All samples were snap frozen, then airbrushed with filtered seawater. 0.5 mL of the homogenate was aliquoted then re-frozen at -80 &deg;C. New samples indicate first extraction for that colony, redo indicates secondary extraction for that colony because the initial extraction had poor yields.

| Vial   	| Sample Type      	| Year 	| Coral ID 	| New/Re-do 	|
|--------	|------------------	|------	|----------	|-----------	|
| 18-227 	| Adult Homogenate 	| 2018 	| R-11-A   	| Re-do     	|
| 18-239 	| Adult Homogenate 	| 2018 	| R-8-B    	| Re-do     	|
| 18-311 	| Adult Homogenate 	| 2018 	| P-10-B   	| Re-do     	|


### Quantify Results

### Qubit

To test DNA quantity: [Qubit](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Qubit-Protocol.md)  


DNA: Broad Range

|            	| DNA (ng/uL) 	|
|------------	|-------------	|
| Standard 1 	| 191.39      	|
| Standard 2 	| 22110.47    	|
| 18-227     	| 29.2        	|
| 18-239     	| 20.0        	|

### Gel Electrophoresis
To test DNA quality: [Gel Electrophoresis](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-16-Gel-Electrophoresis-Protocol.md)

- Today I did a small gel of the above protocol and ran it at 100V.
