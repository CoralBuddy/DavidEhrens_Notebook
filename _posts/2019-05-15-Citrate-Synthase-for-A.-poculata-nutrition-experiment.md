# Background

* Analyzing citrate synthase concentrations from host and symbiont fractions (from the [homogenate prep protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Adult-coral-Homogenate-prep-and-symbiont-separation/)) for the Astrangia nutrition project
* After separating each fraction, protein concentrations for all host and symbiont fractions were quantified using the [BCA Protein Assay](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/images/Pierce_BCA_Protein_Assay.pdf)
* Only samples with >1 &mu;g/20 &mu;L of protein were used (the suggested range of protein is between 1-6 &mu;g/20 &mu;L)
* Samples with >6 &mu;g/ 20 &mu;L were diluted in half
* The [citrate synthase protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Citrate-Synthase-Troubleshooting/) was used, with volume modifications to accommodate 150 wells

# Samples
* The samples used in this experiment were:
  * 15-H, 21-H, 27-H, 33-H, 29-H, 45-H, 51-H, 57-H, 69-H, 75-H, 81-H, 87-H, 93-H, 99-H, 105-H 111-H, 117-H, 123-H, 129-H, 135-H, 147-H, 153-H, 21-S, 33-S, 39-S, 45-S, 51-S, 75-S, 81-S, 87-S, 105-S, 111-S, 117-S, 123-S, 129-S, 135-S, 153-S, 159-H, 165-H, 171-H

# Master Mix
* Calculations
  * (73 samples + 2 standards) x 2 replicates = 150 wells
* For 150 wells:
  * 3.3 &mu;L x 150 = 495 &mu;L Acetyl CoA
  * 5 &mu;L x 150 = 750 &mu;L DNTB
  * 161.7 &mu;L x 150 = 24.255 mL Assay Buffer

# Assay Buffer (1x) Prep
* Need 24.255 mL + 1 mL for OAA = ~26 mL
  * 26 mL DI water + 5.2 mL Assay Buffer (5x)

# Analysis
* The [analysis](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Astrangia_Nutrition/blob/master/RAnalysis/Scripts/Citrate_Synthase.R) and [plate layout](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Astrangia_Nutrition/blob/master/RAnalysis/Data/CS_Well_metadata.csv) can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Astrangia_Nutrition)
