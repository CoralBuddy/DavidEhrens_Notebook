Using the Zymo Quick-DNA Mini Prep kit on adult *Astrangia poculata* samples from the [Astrangia Nutrition Experiment](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Astrangia_Nutrition).

# Experimental design

All samples were snap frozen on 20190417 and stored at -80C. 8 randomly selected corals were airbrushed on 20190418 and aliquoted appropriately. DNA extractions were performed on the same day.

| Vial # | Coral ID | Volume of Sample (mL) |
|:------:|:--------:|:---------------------:|
|   13   |   2753   |          0.5          |
|   19   |   1709   |          0.5          |

|   43   |   2014   |          0.5          |
|   49   |   2189   |          0.5          |
|   55   |   2564   |          0.5          |

# Methods

1. All samples were stored at -20C until all corals were airbrushed and ready to be extracted for DNA.
2. Once thawed, all samples were centrifuged to separate the host and symbionts.
3. 200uL of the supernatant (host) was transferred to a new 1.5mL tube and used for the DNA extraction.
4. The rest of the extraction followed [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Zymo-Quick-DNA-Mini-Prep-Kit-Troubleshooting-on-Adult-P.-astreoides/)

# Quantification

Quantified DNA concentration using 1 uL of sample on the Qubit
