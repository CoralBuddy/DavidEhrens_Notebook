# DNA/RNA extractions for Porties Thermal Transplant Trial #1 - ADULTS

### Goal
To stream line the protocol for DNA/RNA extractions for *Porites astreoides* for the Thermal Transplant 2018 experiment

### Samples
To start, I am using 5 adult *P. astreoides* samples that were already chipped (~0.5mm diameter) and placed in 500 uL of DNA/RNA Shield.

**Sample Numbers: 29, 25, 33, 49, 23**

### Protocol description
I used a modified version of [this protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Soft-and-Hard-Homogenization-Protocol/) written by [E. Strand](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/). I only did the soft homogenization protocol because I am only interested in extraction coral DNA/RNA.

### Protocol Preparation

**Reagents and supplies**
- RNAse Away
- RNA/DNA shield   
- RNAse-free water
- Proteinase K digestion buffer
- Proteinase K  
- Isopropanol  
- 10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 made with RNase-free water  
- 10% bleach
- Zymo Duet DNA/RNA Extraction kit buffers: DNA/RNA lysis buffer, DNA/RNA Prep Buffer, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer, DNA Digestion buffer, and DNase I

**Equipment**  
- Rocking oven that can be set at 55 &deg;C
- Thermomixer
- Vortexer  
- Qiagen Tissue Lyser: [Handbook](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=65e7826c-4d50-4faf-8154-2fbc782c41a6&lang=en)
- Bead tubes: 2mL 0.5mm glass beads and tubes from [Fisher Scientific](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152)
- Designated RNAse free space  
- Tabletop and larger centrifuges for 1.5 mL capable of 12,000xg  
- Clippers

### Reagent Preparation

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) 20 mg Proteinase K with 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer or lyophilized (freeze-dried) 5 mg Proteinase K with 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Vortex to dissolve. Store at -20 &deg;C.

### Soft Homogenization
1. Thaw samples from -80 &deg;C.
2. Add 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield to make the total volume 1 mL
3. Add ~0.25 μl of 0.5mm glass beads to each sample
4. Vortex for 2 minutes. Leave the settings on and on max power.
5. Remove supernatant from the bead tube and place in a new 1.5 microcentrifuge tube labeled on the side with the extraction sample number and today's date. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the sample number. This supernatant will become the sample for "soft homogenization".  
6. Add 300 μl of sample, 30 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 15 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.  
7. Vortex and spin down all tubes.   
8. Place bead tubes and leftover supernatant tubes (~300 μl) in -80 &deg;C freezer.  


## Zymo Duet RNA DNA Extractions

Modified from the [Zymo protocol](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/images/Zymo_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf).

## Testing Quantity and Quality

To test RNA quality: [TapeStation](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-TapeStation-Protocol.md)

### Solution Key:
**DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer**: Contains a high concentration of chaotropic salts, which destabilize hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions. This destabilizes proteins, including nucleases. The buffer will also disrupt association of nucleic acids with water.    
**DNA/RNA Wash Buffer**: Used to remove residual proteins and carbohydrates, and purifies the molecular end product.  
**DNase I**: deoxyribonuclease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone, thus degrading DNA. This is used in the RNA extraction step to purify RNA final product.  
**DNA/RNA Prep Buffer**: Ethanol and guanidinium chloride used a deproteinization measure. Guanidinium is a very strong denaturing agent that will dissolve cells and RNAses.  
**EtOH**: the addition of alcohol further enhances and influences the binding of nucleic aicds to the silica (see spin colum description below).  
**10 mM Tris HCl**: DNA is more stable at slightly basic pH and will dissolve faster in a buffer than water. Using Tris instead of water will enhance rehydration of high molecular weight DNA.  
**DNA/RNase free water**: Used as an elution in the RNA extraction steps. RNA can tolerate a slightly acidic pH and dissolves. Warmed water as an elution increases high molecular yield.  
**Yellow DNA/Green RNA Spin Columns**: contain a silica membrane that binds to nucleic acids. Proteins and polysaccharides should be in the flow-through liquid that is discarded while RNA and DNA is kept on the membrane.    
**Proteinase K**: an enzyme that cleaves the peptide bond in proteins next to the carboxyl group of hydrophobic amino acid residues. This decontaminates the sample and leaves purified DNA/RNA.

General workflow of an extraction:  
1. Cell lysis through disruption of cellular membranes  
2. Dehydration and precipitation of the cellular proteins (protein denaturation)  
3. Separation of cellular proteins and other cellular components out of the nucleic acid  
4. Precipitation and dissolving the nucleic acid  

# Quanitity Results

### Qubit

5 samples + 2 standards + 1 error = 8

**DNA Broad Range**

199 µl Buffer x 8 = 1592 µl Buffer
1 µl Reagent x 8 = 8 µl Reagent

**RNA Broad Range**

199 µl Buffer x 8 = 1592 µl Buffer
1 µl Reagent x 8 = 8 µl Reagent

* The first row indicates the DNA qubit results using the DNA broad range standards with black writing on the cap. The standards were very low, therefore I repeated the qubit results with the DNA broad range standards with red writing on the cap.

### TapeStation

* I did not tape sample 49 because there were the open tape only had 5 spots (4 samples + ladder). I will tape this sample at a future date if necessary

# Summary of results

* Overall, there were very low concentrations of DNA and RNA, however the quality of the RNA is relatively good for 2 samples (Sample 23 and 29).
* I did not do a heating digestion step according to this modified protocol from E. Strand. *P. astreoides* has lots of mucus, therefore a heating digestion step with the Proteinase K might be necessary

# Nest steps

* Tomorrow I will try a heating step with the remainder of the  bead-bashed supernatant to determine if this will increase the yield of DNA and RNA.
