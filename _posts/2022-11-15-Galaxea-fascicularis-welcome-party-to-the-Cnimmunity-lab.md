# Welcoming Galaxea fascicularis to the Cnidarian Immunity Lab!
* This post describes the onboarding process of *Galaxea fascicularis* to the Cnidarian Immunity lab at RSMAES.

## Source and Shipping

* The corals were purchased from [Unique corals](https://uniquecorals.com/) and our contact was Emilio (emilio.uniquecorals@gmail.com).
* The corals were harvested from Australia (add coordinates) on (add date)
* The 10 colonies were shipped to [Unique corals](https://uniquecorals.com/) on (add date)
* [Unique corals](https://uniquecorals.com/) shipped them to the Cnidaian Immunity lab at 5pm (PST) on Monday November 14th and they arrived at 10:30 AM (EST) at RSMAES

## Tank Prep

* Prior to arrival, David Ehrens (lab manager) and I build a recirculating tank system that can be both open and closed system. 
* This allows us keep the recircculating water system separate from the Caribbean coral tanks.

## Arrival 
* Once they arrived to RSMAES, Natalia (post doc) and I took the corals out of the transport bags and placed them into recircuclating tank
* We photographed each coral with the Coral Watch Color Chart:

* We then adjust the colonies and lights to make sure all of the corals were reciving 110-160 PAR using an apogee light meter

## Iodine soak
* Aprroximately 1 hour later, David and I performed an iodine bath with [Lugol Solution](https://www.carolina.com/specialty-chemicals-d-l/lugol-solution/FAM_872793.pr) for each coloing using the following protocol: 
    * 0.5 mL per L of water, therefore 2.5mL of [Lugol Solution](https://www.carolina.com/specialty-chemicals-d-l/lugol-solution/FAM_872793.pr) in 5L of seawater
    * The corals were placed in the bath for 10 minutes with occasional water movement and pipetting
    * Visible expulsion of benthic invertebrates

* Corals looked visibily healthy with no tissue loss compared to yesterday.

* Corals were fed with Reef Roids by David
    * Water and pumps were turned off
    * X concentration of reef roids were fed
    * Water and pumps were turned back on 1 hour later
