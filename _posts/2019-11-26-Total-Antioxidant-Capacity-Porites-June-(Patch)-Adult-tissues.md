The goal of this protocol is to determine the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in adult coral tissues from the Porites Nutition June experiment using the [OxiSelect Total Antioxidant Capacity Assay kit](https://www.cellbiolabs.com/total-antioxidant-capacity-tac-assay).

The protocol for this assay can be found [here](https://www.cellbiolabs.com/sites/default/files/STA-360-total-antioxidant-capacity-assay-kit.pdf)

# Sample Description and Preparation

* The samples used in this assay are from the airbrushed homogenates from [this notebook entry](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Airbrushing-and-Homogenizing-Porites-June-Patch-Adult-Tissues/)
* 500ul of homogenate were used per sample
* Frozen homogenates were thawed on ice
* To separate host and symbiont fractions, the thawed homogenates were centrifuged at 5200 RPM for 5 minutes at 4°C
* The supernatant was transferred into two replicate tubes on ice:
  1. 100uL for TAC analysis
  2. 400uL for total protein analysis

# Reagent preparation
*Prepare all reagents and store at 4°C for a maximum of 3 months*

**1X Reaction Buffer**
* dilute to 1:100
* 400uL kit Reaction buffer + 39.6mL of 1X PBS

**1X Copper Ion Solution**
* dilute to 1:100
* 1mL kit Reaction buffer + 99mL of DI H2O

**1X Stop Solution**
* dilute to 1:10
* 1.5mL kit Stop Solution + 13.5mL of DI H2O

# Standard Preparation

1. Prepare a 10 mg/mL (60 mM) uric acid solution with 1M NaOH
  * 10mg Uric Acid Powder + 1 mL 1M NaOH
2. Dilute to a 2mM solution of Uric Acid
  * 100uL of 60mM Uric Acid + 2.9mL of DI H2O
3. Create a serial dilution to match the table below:

* For this entry, I did not use standards #4 and #7 to fit all of the samples on one plate

# Assay Protocol

1. Add 20uL of the Diluted uric acid standards or samples to the 96-well microtiter plate.
2. Add 180uL of the 1X Reaction Buffer to each well using a multi-channel pipette. Pipette mix.
3. Obtain initial absorbance by reading the plate at 490nm
4. Add 50uL of the 1X Copper Ion Reagent into each well. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature on an orbital shaker.
5. Add 50uL of the 1X stop solution to each well using a multi-channel pipette.
6. Read plate again at 490nm
