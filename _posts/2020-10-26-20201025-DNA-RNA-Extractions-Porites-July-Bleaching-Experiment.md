**Project:** [Porites Bleaching 2019](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Porites_Rim_Bleaching_2019)


### Goal
To test DNA and RNA extractions on adult *Porites astreoides* samples for the Porites Bleaching 2019 experiment using a modified version of [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-on-P.-astreoides-larvae-BEAD-BEATING/). I am trying to increase RNA quality from [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20201022-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Porites-July-Bleaching-Experiment/).

### Samples

Today I am using 3 adult *P. astreoides* samples that were snap frozen in the field. All of these samples are whole fragments that are stored at -80&deg;C.

| Vial # 	| Timepoint 	| Coral ID 	|
|:------:	|:---------:	|:--------:	|
|    7   	|     A1    	|    R26   	|
|    8   	|     A2    	|    R29   	|
|    9   	|     A1    	|    R40   	|



### Sample Preparation and Digestion
1. Add 0.25 mL of glass beads (0.5mm) and add 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield into each empty centrifuge tube.
2. Take samples out from -80 &deg;C on dry ice.
3. Using sterile clippers, add 0.25mm of tissue into the centrifuge tube with beads and RNA/DNA shield.  
4. Vortex at max speed for 1 minute.
5. Remove 400 μl of the supernatant and transfer to a new centrifuge tube.
6. Centrifuge at 9000 rcf for 3 minutes.
7. Transfer 300 μl supernatant to a new centrifuge tube and discard the pellet.
8. Add 30 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 15 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to each sample.
9. Vortex and spin down.
10. Add 345 μl of lysis buffer.
11. Continue with DNA and RNA extraction protocol

### Quantify Results

### Qubit
To test DNA quantity: [Qubit](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Qubit-Protocol.md)  

I used DNA and RNA broad range.

|            	| DNA (ng/uL) 	| RNA (ng/uL) 	|
|:----------:	|:-----------:	|:-----------:	|
| Standard 1 	|    200.62   	|    402.57   	|
| Standard 2 	|   22583.64  	|   9106.48   	|
|      7     	|     10.0    	|     21.0    	|
|      8     	|     4.62    	|     13.4    	|
|      9     	|     14.3    	|     17.0    	|


### Gel

I attempted to run a gel on the extracted DNA of these samples but the sample did not load into the gel (i.e. it rose out of the gel when loading).
