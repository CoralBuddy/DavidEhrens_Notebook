# Thermal Stress

Thermal Stress test for Galaxea fasicularis TEM imaging: 

## Tank prep

* One mesocosm raceway with two wave pumps and an independent sump with three heaters connected to the Apex system.
* One 5 gallon tank with a mini water pump and two lines for water input 

## 20230316
* Colony D was cut into three pieces (~5cm x 5cm) and glued to square pcv plates.
* The three fragments were immediately fed with ReefRoids and left to acclimate/recover in the raceway

## 20230321
* The tank was cleaned and the water was drained/refilled
* One of the three fragments was placed in the glass 5 gallon tank once temperatures returned back to 28C
* 1 photograph was taken with the colored ruler for bleaching score
* Light was recorded at 96 PAR
* Apex settings for the 3 heaters were set to as followed: 
    * On temperature: 28.5
    * Off tempeature: 29.0
    * Time set: 14:00
* We are aiming for a 1 degree increase per day until we reach 35C

## 20230325
* Apex settings for the 3 heaters were set to as followed: 
    * On temperature: 32.5
    * Off tempeature: 33.0
    * Time set: 14:08


## 20230326
* Apex settings for the 3 heaters were set to as followed: 
    * On temperature: 33.5
    * Off tempeature: 34.0
    * Time set: 13:15

## 20230327
* Apex settings for the 3 heaters were set to as followed: 
    * On temperature: 33.5
    * Off tempeature: 34.0
    * Incoming water was reduced as the tank temperatures were not reaching 34C. Seems to have worked.
