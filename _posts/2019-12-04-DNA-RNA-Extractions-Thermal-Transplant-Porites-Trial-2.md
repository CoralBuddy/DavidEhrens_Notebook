DNA/RNA extractions for Porites Thermal Transplant Trial #2 - ADULTS

### Goal
To stream line the protocol for DNA/RNA extractions for *Porites astreoides* for the Thermal Transplant 2018 experiment by adding a heating incubation step to digest sample more.

### Protocol description
I used a modified version of [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-Thermal-Transplant-Porites-Trial-1/) from 20191203 extraction.


### Samples
I am using the extra supernatant from the sample bead bashed with DNA/RNA shield. Therefore I will have a direct comparison of the extra incubation digestion step. The sample numbers will be the same as 20191203, but the tubes will be labelled "B-#".

**Sample Numbers: 29, 25, 33, 49, 23**

## Testing Quantity and Quality

### Solution Key:
**DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer**: Contains a high concentration of chaotropic salts, which destabilize hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions. This destabilizes proteins, including nucleases. The buffer will also disrupt association of nucleic acids with water.    
**DNA/RNA Wash Buffer**: Used to remove residual proteins and carbohydrates, and purifies the molecular end product.  
**DNase I**: deoxyribonuclease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone, thus degrading DNA. This is used in the RNA extraction step to purify RNA final product.  
**DNA/RNA Prep Buffer**: Ethanol and guanidinium chloride used a deproteinization measure. Guanidinium is a very strong denaturing agent that will dissolve cells and RNAses.  
**EtOH**: the addition of alcohol further enhances and influences the binding of nucleic aicds to the silica (see spin colum description below).  
**10 mM Tris HCl**: DNA is more stable at slightly basic pH and will dissolve faster in a buffer than water. Using Tris instead of water will enhance rehydration of high molecular weight DNA.  
**DNA/RNase free water**: Used as an elution in the RNA extraction steps. RNA can tolerate a slightly acidic pH and dissolves. Warmed water as an elution increases high molecular yield.  
**Yellow DNA/Green RNA Spin Columns**: contain a silica membrane that binds to nucleic acids. Proteins and polysaccharides should be in the flow-through liquid that is discarded while RNA and DNA is kept on the membrane.    
**Proteinase K**: an enzyme that cleaves the peptide bond in proteins next to the carboxyl group of hydrophobic amino acid residues. This decontaminates the sample and leaves purified DNA/RNA.

General workflow of an extraction:  
1. Cell lysis through disruption of cellular membranes  
2. Dehydration and precipitation of the cellular proteins (protein denaturation)  
3. Separation of cellular proteins and other cellular components out of the nucleic acid  
4. Precipitation and dissolving the nucleic acid  

# Quanitify Results

### Qubit

5 samples + 2 standards + 1 error = 8

**DNA Broad Range**

199 µl Buffer x 8 = 1592 µl Buffer
1 µl Reagent x 8 = 8 µl Reagent

**RNA Broad Range**

199 µl Buffer x 8 = 1592 µl Buffer
1 µl Reagent x 8 = 8 µl Reagent

|     | S1     | S2       | 23   | 49   | 33   | 25   | 29   |
|-----|--------|----------|------|------|------|------|------|
| DNA | 161.89 | 21813.48 | 5.18 | 2.46 | 9.34 | 2.7  | 2.94 |
| RNA | 382.04 | 10595.29 | 22.8 | 11.8 | 16.6 | 18.0 | 32.8 |

* Initally, I started using the DNA broad range standards (as described in the [the 20191203 protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-Thermal-Transplant-Porites-Trial-1/)), however they gave readings of: S1 = 84.50 and S2 = 6972.01. Therefore I used Dr. Puritz's standards and got the values above.

### TapeStation

* Sample 33 went on the tape station but it was not read properly.

# Summary of results

* Overall, the incubation step did not increase the yield of DNA or RNA that much. The RNA quality was much worse when incubated. Additionally, it was noted that the final RNA elution was green in tint and the RNA filter in the column was green. This could be the source of error in the tape station results and also contribute to the slight increase in RNA qubit values.

# Next steps

* Tomorrow, I will test 2 samples with no heating incubation step. Additionally, I will beat beat for 3-4 minutes and input the entire volume of DNA/RNA shield (~800-900 uL) into the column. Hopefully, this will increase the sample input in the column, therefore increasing the yield and maintaining the RNA quality with no heating step.
