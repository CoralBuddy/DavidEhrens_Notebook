# Reagent Preparation

### Extraction Buffer
* This extraction buffer is a ratio of 40:40:20 of methanol, acetonitrile, and water, with 0.5%[v/v] Formic Acid
* For a total of 200mL extraction buffer:
  * 80mL methanol
  * 80mL acetonitrile
  * 40mL water
  * 1mL formic acid
* Store at 4&deg;C in a non-flammable fridge

### 15% Ammonium Bicarbonate Solution
* Solubility of Ammonium bicarbonate in water is: 220g/L for 100%
* 100% Ammonium Bicarbonate solution (250mL)
  * 55g dry Ammonium bicarbonate in 250mL LCMS water
* 15% Ammonium Bicarbonate Solution (250mL)
  * 37.5mL of 100% Ammonium Bicarbonate Solution + 212.5mL LCMS water
* Store at 4&deg;C in a non-flammable fridge

# Samples
* For this test, I am using multiple concentrations of larvae (8 samples) and adult tissue biopsies (4 samples). ALl samples were previously snap frozen and stored at -80&deg;C
  * Larvae are from a thermal stress experiment in 2017. All larvae were from the ambient treatment and from the patch reef.
  * Adults were from a histology experiment in 2018 and from 2 reef zones

# Preparation of samples before extraction

### Larvae
* Thaw larvae on ice.
* Remove any residual seawater.
* Add 500uL of the extraction buffer to the vial and then transfer to the dounce.
* Add 500uL of the extraction buffer to the dounce and wait 5 minutes on ice.

### Adult
* Label and weigh the vial empty, then with 1mL of the extraction buffer
* Using sterile clippers, clip approximately 0.5mm of coral tissue into the vial with 1mL of the extraction buffer.
* Weigh the vial with the extraction buffer and coral.
* Wait for 5 minutes on ice then transfer to dounce.

# Extraction Protocol
* After waiting 5 minutes, homogenize the sample until the supernatant is visibly pigmented.
* Add an additional 500uL of cold extraction buffer to rinse the pestle.
* Strain the extract through a 100um cell strainer into a 50mL receptacle.
* Transfer extract to a new 1.5 mL tube.
* Vortex and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 15000g at 4&deg;C.
* Remove 500uL of the supernatant to a new 1.5mL tube.
* Add 44uL of 15% ammonium bicarbonate.
* Vortex and spin down.
* Add 100uL into duplicate, labeled autosampler vials.
* Store 1.5mL tube and autosampler vials at -80&deg;C.
