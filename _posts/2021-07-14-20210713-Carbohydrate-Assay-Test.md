### Goal

First at the carbohydrate assay using the unmodified protocol from [Bove_Baumann_96well_Protocol](https://www.protocols.io/view/coral-carbohydrate-assay-for-96-well-plates-bvb9n2r6).

The working Putnam Lab Carbohydrate protocol is [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/tree/master/Lab_Resourses/Physiology_Protocols/Carbohydrates/Bove_Baumann_96well_Protocol

### Samples

For this protocol, I used airbrushed homogenates of Porites astreoides (Proj: Porites Nutrition 2019), Montipora capitata (Proj: Holobiont Integration), and Pocillopora acuta (Proj: Holobiont Integration). These were extra coral homogenates that were frozen is 50mL falcon tubes.

Samples were taken out of the -80C freezer to thaw. Once thawed, 1 mL aliquots were put into the Holobiont and Symbiont tubes. The symbiont tubes were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 15000 rcf. The supernatant was transferred to the associated 'coral' tube and the pellet was resuspended in 1X PBS (phosphate buffer saline).

| Vial | Fragment ID |    Species    | Fraction |
|:----:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:--------:|
|   1  |    P22-A2   | P. astreoides |   Coral  |
|   2  |    P22-A2   | P. astreoides | Symbiont |
|   3  |    M1822    |  M. capitata  |   Coral  |
|   4  |    M1822    |  M. capitata  | Symbiont |
|   5  |    P1170    |    P. acuta   |   Coral  |
|   6  |    P1170    |    P. acuta   | Symbiont |
