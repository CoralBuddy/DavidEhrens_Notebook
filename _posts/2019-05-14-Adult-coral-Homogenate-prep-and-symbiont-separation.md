# Background
This protocol is used to separate coral tissue slurry that is homogenized into host (coral) and symbiont (*Symbiodinaceae*) fractions. The samples used in this protocol were from the *Astrangia poculata* nutrition experiment run by K. Wong in April 2019. Corals were snap frozen, airbrushed with filtered seawater, homogenized with a glass homogenizer, aliquoted appropriately (500 &mu;L in each tube), and frozen at -80°C. This homogenate separation will be used for citrate synthase analyses and DNA extractions

# Equipment and reagents needed
* Ice bucket
* Lysis buffer
* Wash buffer
* Vortex
* Centrifuge that can maintain 4°C

# Reagent preparation
### Lysis buffer
* Can be found in [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Citrate-Synthase-Troubleshooting/)
* To make 250 mL of lysis buffer, add:
  * 6.25 mL 1 M Tris (pH 8)
  * 0.5 mL 0.5 M EDTA
  * 25 mL 100% glycerol [v/v]
  * 218.25 mL DI water
* Store at 4°C

### Wash buffer
* 250 mL of lysis buffer
* 25 &mu;L of 0.01% [v/v] Triton X
* Store at 4°C

# Protocol
**All steps must be performed on ice or at 4°C**

1. Thaw samples on ice and add 0.6mL of ice-cold lysis buffer
2. Vortex samples and check cell integrity on a hemocytometer
3. Centrifuge at 6000g for 2 mins at 4°C
4. Remove 800 &mu;L of supernatant and transfer to a new labelled tube (host fraction)
5. Place symbiont pellet on ice

**--- HOST FRACTION ---**
6. Centrifuge host fraction at 16000g for 20 minutes at 4°C to remove any particulate debris
7. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and vortex
8. Aliquot appropriately and store at -80°C for further analyses
  * e.g. 600 &mu;L for DNA extractions, 100 &mu;L for citrate synthase, and 50 &mu;L for protein.

9. Resuspend pellet in 200 &mu;L of lysis buffer
10. Vortex and centrifuge at 700g for 5 minutes at 4°C
11. Remove and discard supernatant
12. Resuspend pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold wash buffer
13. Repeat steps 10-12 for a total of 5 times
14. Resuspend pellet in 300 &mu;L of lysis buffer and add and 200 &mu;L of 0.5mm diameter glass beads
15. Vortex for 3 minutes
16. Remove supernatant and aliquot accordingly
  * e.g. 200 &mu;L for DNA extractions, 50 &mu;L for citrate synthase, and 50 &mu;L for protein
