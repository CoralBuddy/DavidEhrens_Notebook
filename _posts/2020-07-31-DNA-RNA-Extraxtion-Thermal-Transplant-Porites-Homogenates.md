### Goal
To test the protocol for DNA/RNA extractions for airbrushed homogenates of *Porites astreoides* for the Thermal Transplant 2017/2018 experiment.

### Samples
I used 6 adult *P. astreoides* samples that were snap frozen, then airbrushed with filtered seawater. 0.5 mL of the homogenate was aliquoted then re-frozen at -80 &deg;C. I used 3 corals from two different time points of the experiment, post treatment (2017) and post-transplant (2018)

**Sample Numbers**
- 17-26
  - P12-T2 (2017: Patch + High Treatment)
- 17-295
  - R7-T2 (2017: Rim + Ambient Treatment)
- 17-682
  - R19-T2 (2017: Rim + High Treatment)
- 18-19
  - R7-B (2018: Rim + Ambient Treatment + Rim Transplant)
- 18-31
  - P12-B (2018: Patch + High Treatment + Rim Transplant)
- 18-43
  - R19-B (2018: Patch + High Treatment + Rim Transplant)


### Protocol description
I used a modified version of [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extraction-Protocol/) for homogenates.

### Homogenate preparation
1. Immediately after taking sample out of the -80&deg;C freezer, add 500&mu;L of DNA/RNA shield
2. Once fully thawed, add 100 &mu;L of Protenase K digestion buffer (Derived from volume of homogenate and 300/30 ratio from Zymo Protocol) and 50 &mu;L of Protenase K (Derived from volume of homogenate and 300/15 ratio from Zymo Protocol)
4. Vortex and spin down.
5. Incubate on Thermomixer at 56&deg;C at 1500 rpm for 30 minutes
6. Spin down for 30 seconds to pellet any debris
6. Remove 1000 &mu;L of the supernatant and transfer in 5 mL tubes. Avoid any debris.

## Zymo Duet RNA DNA Extractions

Modified from the [Zymo protocol](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/images/Zymo_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf).

## DNA Extraction

  * Vortex to mix
2. Transfer 700 &mu;L into DNA filter column (yellow)
  * Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
  * Remove flow through liquid and transfer into a new 5 mL tube labeled for RNA
3. Repeat steps 2 until all liquid is gone (x 3)
4. Add 400 &mu;L of DNA/RNA prep buffer to column
  * Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
  * Remove the flow through and transfer to waste
5. Add 700 &mu;L of DNA/RNA wash buffer
  * Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
  * Remove the flow through and transfer to waste
6. Add 400 &mu;L of DNA/RNA wash buffer
  * Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 2 minutes

7. Removed column and place into a new sterile 1.5 mL tube
8. Add 50 &mu;L of 10 mM Tris HCL (warmed to 55&deg;C) directly to filter
  * Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes
  * Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
  * Keep flow through in tube
9. Add another 50 &mu;L of 10 mM Tris HCL (warmed to 55&deg;C) directly to filter
  * Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
  * Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
  * Discard column and keep flow through in tube
10. Aliquot 10 &mu;L into PCR tubes for QC.
11. Store remaining aliquot at -20&deg;C

## RNA Extraction
1. Add equal volume of 100% Ethanol (2000 &mu;L) as sample volume to the 5 mL tube with sample
  * Vortex to mix
2. Transfer 700 &mu;L into RNA filter column (green)
  * Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
  * Remove flow through liquid and transfer into a new 5 mL tube labeled for Protein
3. Repeat steps 12 until all liquid is gone
4. Add 400 &mu;L of DNA/RNA wash buffer to column
  * Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
  * Remove the flow through and transfer to waste
5. Make DNase I master mix: [75μL DNA digestion buffer and 5μL DNase] X n (sample #)
> Today I had 6 samples therefore: 450 &mu;L of DNA digestion buffer and 30 &mu;L of DNase I

6. Add 80μL of DNase I master mix directly to the filter of each column. Incubate at room temperature for ~15 minutes
7. Add 400 &mu;L of DNA/RNA prep buffer to column

## Clean-up

2. Wipe down RNA free area with RNase away and kimwipes.  
3. Throw away all tips and restock tip boxes if necessary.
