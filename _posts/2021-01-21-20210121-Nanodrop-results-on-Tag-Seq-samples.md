**Project:** [Porites Bleaching 2019](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Porites_Rim_Bleaching_2019)

### Goal

Testing the purity of extracted RNA from 4 *Porites astreoides* and 3 geoduck samples (from S. Gurr). For the blank I used 2 different Ultra Pure H20: (1) was from the RNA bench which was used for the dilution for Tag-Seq, and (2) an unopened bottle. "-1" indicates (1) water was used for the blank and "-2" indicates (2) water was used for the blank.

### Results

| Sample | A260/280 | A260/230 | Concentration (ng/uL) |    Species   |

| 1510-1 |   2.12   |   0.57   |         177.6         |    Geoduck   |
| 1510-2 |   2.12   |   0.58   |         180.2         |    Geoduck   |

### Conclusions

- The water did not contribute to the potential contamination in the RNA
- All of the *P. astreoides* samples look similar to the nanodrop results at the sequencing center
- 2 of the geoduck samples also looked like they were contaminated similarly to the *P. astreoides* samples
