# ZYMO Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit Troubleshooting

## Goal
* To determine if both DNA and RNA extracts can be obtained from an adult coral homogenate (see [airbrushing protocol](https://hputnam.github.io/Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Coral_Tissue_Removal_protocol/)) and a biopsy of adult tissue and skeleton. The coral used for this test was *Porites astreoides* collected from Bermuda.

## Experimental design
Table 1: Experimental Design to test DNA/RNA extraction methods on 2 types of coral tissues.

| Sample # | Sample Type | Coral ID/Vial# | Volume/Size of Sample |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:---------------------:|
|     1    |  Homogenate |       951      |         500 mL        |
|     2    |  Homogenate |       954      |         500 mL        |
|     3    |   Fragment  |      R20-A     |     ~10 mm diameter   |
|     4    |   Fragment  |      R20-A     |     ~10 mm diameter   |

#### Overall workflow
1. Prepare samples
2. Extract and prep DNA with column (elute RNA and Protein)
3. Extract and prep RNA with column (elute Protein)
4. Quantify DNA, RNA, and protein extracts

## Protocol preparation

* Using slightly modified [Zymo Duet DNA/RNA extraction protocol](https://www.zymoresearch.com/media/amasty/amfile/attach/_D7003_ZR-Duet_DNA-RNA_MiniPrep_Plus_ver_1.0.1.pdf) which will extract both DNA and RNA at the same time (Below are summary steps)

#### Reagents and supplies
* RNase-free Water
* 100% ethanol, ACS grade or better
* 10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 made with RNase-free water
* ZR BBashing lysis tubes with 0.1mm and 0.5mm beads

#### Equipment
* Rocking oven that can be set to 55°C
* RNase away and a designated RNase free space
* Tabletop and larger centrifuges for 1.5mL and 50mL tubes capable of 12,000 x g

#### Clipper Sterilization
* Rub down clippers with:
  1. 10% Bleach solution
  2. DI water
  3. 90% ethanol
  4. RNAse free water

#### Notes before starting
* Wipe down benchtop with RNase away and have the spray bottle and kimwipes on-hand to use frequently

## Sample preparation

#### Homogenate preparation
* Immediately after taking sample out of the -80&deg;C freezer, add 500&mu;L of DNA/RNA shield
* Add 100 &mu;L of Protenase K digestion buffer
  * Derived from volume of homogenate and 300/30 ratio from Zymo Protocol
* Add 50 &mu;L of Protenase K
  * Derived from volume of homogenate and 300/15 ratio from Zymo Protocol
* Incubate on Thermomixer at 56&deg;C at 600 rpm for 30 minutes
* Remove all liquid (1150 &mu;L) and transfer in 5 mL tubes

#### Fragment preparation
* Sterilize clippers (as outlined above)
* Clip off ~10mm in diameter of tissue and skeleton and place into ZR BBashing lysis tube
* Add 1000 &mu;L of DNA/RNA shield (may be too much)
* Vortex for ~1 minute
* Remove 500 &mu;L of supernatant and transfer into 5mL tube
  * Large mucus chunks made this step difficult --> potential source of error

## Quantification

### Qubit

* For the Qubit readings, 10 &mu;L of each standard were used and 1 &mu;L of each sample were used.

Table 2: Qubit readings for the extracted DNA and RNA samples.

|     | Standard 1 (RFV) | Standard 2 (RFV) |  #1 (ng/uL)  |  #2 (ng/uL)  |  #3 (ng/uL)  | #4 (ng/uL) |
|:---:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:----------:|
| DNA |      205.05      |     22675.65     | 16.70, 16.10 | 13.00, 13.00 |  8.24, 8.10  | 3.02, 2.98 |
| RNA |      393.14      |     11692.94     | 10.20, 10.00 | 11.80, 11.60 | 12.60, 12.40 |   Too low  |

### Tapestation
* Only RNA samples were run on the tape station
* Due to the low sample reading from sample #4, it was not run on the tapestation

## Conclusions
* Homogenates from airbrushed coral tissue can only be used for DNA, RNA is too degraded
* Need to troubleshoot homogenizing coral fragment with beadbeating, but it is possible to extract RNA using this protocol
