DNA extractions for Porites Thermal Transplant ADULTS BATCH #1

### Goal
To process DNA for *Porites astreoides* adult homogenates for the Thermal Transplant 2018 experiment using a modified version of [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Zymo-Quick-DNA-Mini-Prep-Kit-Troubleshooting-on-Adult-P.-astreoides/).

### Samples

All samples were snap frozen, then airbrushed with filtered seawater. 0.5 mL of the homogenate was aliquoted then re-frozen at -80 &deg;C.

| Vial   	| Sample Type      	| Coral         	|
|--------	|------------------	|---------------	|
| 17-628 	| Adult Homogenate 	| P-10 (2017)   	|
| 17-277 	| Adult Homogenate 	| R-8 (2017)    	|
| 18-142 	| Adult Homogenate 	| R-8-A (2018)  	|
| 18-358 	| Adult Homogenate 	| P-10-A (2018) 	|

### Sample Preparation and Digestion

* Following the Biological fluids and cell protocol

1. Take samples out from -80 &deg;C.
2. Immediately added 500uL Biofluid Cell Buffer (red) and 50 μl of Proteinase K to each sample.
4. Vortex and spin down.
5. Incubate for 30 minutes at 55 &deg;C on 1100 rpm.
6. Centrifuge at 8,000 rcf for 30 seconds to remove debris.
7. Transfer 1000 μl of the supernatant to a new, labelled 5 ml centrifuge tube.  

## DNA Extraction
1. Add equal volume (1000 uL) of Genomic Binding Buffer to each 5 ml tube
  * Finger flick to mix
2. Add 700 uL of the 5 mL tube to the spin column
  * Centrifuge at 12,000 g (rcf) for 1 minute
3. Transfer spin column to a new column (discard previous column)
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the liquid is gone (3x)
5. Add 400 uL pre-wash buffer to each spin column
  * Centrifuge at 12,000 g (rcf) for 1 minute
6. Remove and discard flow through
7. Add 700 uL pre-wash buffer to each spin column
  * Centrifuge at 12,000 g (rcf) for 1 minute
8. Remove and discard flow through
9. Add 200 uL wash buffer to each spin column
  * Centrifuge at 12,000 g (rcf) for 2 minute
10. Transfer spin columns to new 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes
11. Add 50 uL of warmed 10mM Tris HCl  directly to the filter in the spin column
  * Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes
12. Centrifuge at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
13. Add another 50 uL of warmed 10mM Tris HCl directly to the filter in the spin column
  * Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
14. Centrifuge at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
15. Label final tubes
16. Aliquot 10 uL into labelled PCR tubes for QC
17. Store labelled samples in -20 &deg;C

### Gel Electrophoresis
To test DNA quality: [Gel Electrophoresis](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-16-Gel-Electrophoresis-Protocol.md)

- Today I did a small gel of the above protocol and ran it at 100V.
