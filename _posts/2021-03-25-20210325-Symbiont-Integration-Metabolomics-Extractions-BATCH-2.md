**Project:** Symbiont Integration

**Metric and Protocol:** [Metabolomic extractions](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Metabolomics-P-astreoides-sample-prep/)

**Batch Number:** 2

### Goal
To prepare lab materials and process metabolomic extractions on multiple life stages of *M. capitata* samples for the Symbiont Integration experiment using the [larval protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Metabolomics-P-astreoides-sample-prep/).

### Laboratory preparation

1. Autoclaved all glass ware.
2. Wiped down all counter tops and fumehood with 10% bleach solution.
3. Obtained dry ice.
4. Took aliquots of master extraction buffer and 15% ammonium bicarbonate solutions for today's extractions.

### Samples

AH Samples that were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&deg;C.

I noticed some samples had low pigment coloration (Larvae 5/6/recruits) possibly due to low sample input. Therefore, I reduced the amount of extraction buffer to potentially increase the signal intensity.

All samples were loaded into duplicate vials (A and B) and additional extracts were saved in the same box and stored at -80&deg;C.
