This protocol is adapted to determine total protein content using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit from Thermo Scientific.

1. Thaw homogenized tissues
2. For 200 &mu;L of coral larval tissues, add 10 &mu;L of **1M NaOH** (pH should be ~10) into each vial
    * The vial will be too small to fit a pH probe, therefore pipette a very small amount onto pH paper
3. Incubate each vial at 50Â°C for 4 hours shaking at 300rpm
4. Add 280 &mu;L of **0.1M HCl** to each vial to neutralize the sample
    * Add the HCl in small increments and test pH
    * pH should be at 7 - use more/less HCl depending on your sample
    * Ensure pH is at 7 before moving on to the next steps
5. Now use this prepared sample for the BCA protocol.

During the 4 hour incubation, follow the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit instructions to prepare the BSA standards and working reagents. Use the micro plate procedure if using the plate spectrophotometer.
