DNA/RNA extractions for Porites Thermal Transplant Trial #1 - LARVAE

### Goal
To stream line the protocol for DNA/RNA extractions for *Porites astreoides* LARVAE for the Thermal Transplant 2018 experiment.

### Samples

Today I am using 3 larval *P. astreoides* samples that were snap frozen in the field. Each vial has 20 larvae.

**Sample Numbers: 713, 505, and 546**

### Protocol description
I used a modified version of [this protocol](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/) written by [E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/).

- RNAse-free water
- Proteinase K digestion buffer
- Proteinase K  
- Isopropanol  
- 10mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 made with RNase-free water  
- 10% bleach

**Equipment**  
- Rocking oven that can be set at 55 &deg;C
- Thermomixer
- Vortexer  
- Qiagen Tissue Lyser: [Handbook](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=65e7826c-4d50-4faf-8154-2fbc782c41a6&lang=en)

### Reagent Preparation

1. Add 96 mL 100% ethanol (104 mL 95% ethanol) to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. DNA/RNA Wash Buffer included with D7003T (Mini Prep Plus Kit) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol prior to use. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.  
2. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. Mix by inversion. Store frozen aliquots.  
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) 20 mg Proteinase K with 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer or lyophilized (freeze-dried) 5 mg Proteinase K with 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Vortex to dissolve. Store at -20 &deg;C.

### Sample Preparation and Digestion
1. Take samples out from -80 &deg;C.
2. Immediately add 300 μl of RNA/DNA shield.
3. Add 30 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 15 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to each sample.
4. Vortex and spin down.
5. Incubate for 3.5 hours at 55 &deg;C on 1100 rpm. Check periodically to see if the samples have broken down
  * Sample 713 still had visible debris floating in the supernatant. Samples 505 and 546 were completely digested in 1 hour.
6. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds to remove debris.
7. Transfer 350 μl of the supernatant to a new, labelled 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.  

## Zymo Duet RNA DNA Extractions

Modified from the [Zymo protocol](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/images/Zymo_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf).

**DNA Extraction**  
1. Set up yellow DNA spin columns and collection tubes, label appropriately  
2. Warm elution liquids to 70 &deg;C (10mM Tris HCl pH. 8.0 and RNase free water)

4. Finger flick to mix tubes  
5. Add 700 µl (total volume) of sample gently to the yellow DNA spin column  
6. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds  
7. **Important** Save the flow through from this step: transfer to a new 1.5mL tube labeled for RNA  
    * Repeat steps 5-7 until the sample is gone.
8. Add 400 µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns  
9. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds

17. Transfer yellow columns to new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes ("E1")
18. Add 50 µl warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filter    
19. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds **keep the flow through**
21. Add another 50 µl warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow DNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filter   
22. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes.

24. Throw away filter and keep flow through.
24. Aliquot 10 µl of the elution to 0.5 mL PCR tubes for Qubit and Gel Electrophoresis analysis.    
25. Store at 4 &deg;C if quantifying the same day or the next, if waiting longer store in -20 &deg;C freezer.

**RNA Extraction**
*Can do concurrently with DNA Extraction after DNA Extraction Step 7*  
1. Add equal volume (**700 µl**) 100% EtOH to the 1.5 mL tubes labeled for RNA containing the original yellow column flow through  
2. Vortex and spin down to mix  
3. Add 700 µl of that liquid to the green RNA spin columns  
4. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds

7. Centrifuge at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds

25. Repeat steps 25-27 for a final elution volume of 100 µl  
26. Aliquot 5 µl of the final elution to 0.5 mL PCR tubes for Qubit and TapeStation analysis.    
27. Store all tubes in the -80 &deg;C freezer.

## Clean-up
1. Place tissue and liquid in the waste container labeled Zymo extraction waste.  
2. Wipe down RNA free area with RNase away and kimwipes.  
3. Throw away all tips and restock tip boxes if necessary.

### Solution Key:
**DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer**: Contains a high concentration of chaotropic salts, which destabilize hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions. This destabilizes proteins, including nucleases. The buffer will also disrupt association of nucleic acids with water.    
**DNA/RNA Wash Buffer**: Used to remove residual proteins and carbohydrates, and purifies the molecular end product.  
**DNase I**: deoxyribonuclease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone, thus degrading DNA. This is used in the RNA extraction step to purify RNA final product.  
**DNA/RNA Prep Buffer**: Ethanol and guanidinium chloride used a deproteinization measure. Guanidinium is a very strong denaturing agent that will dissolve cells and RNAses.  
**EtOH**: the addition of alcohol further enhances and influences the binding of nucleic aicds to the silica (see spin colum description below).  
**10 mM Tris HCl**: DNA is more stable at slightly basic pH and will dissolve faster in a buffer than water. Using Tris instead of water will enhance rehydration of high molecular weight DNA.  
**DNA/RNase free water**: Used as an elution in the RNA extraction steps. RNA can tolerate a slightly acidic pH and dissolves. Warmed water as an elution increases high molecular yield.  
**Yellow DNA/Green RNA Spin Columns**: contain a silica membrane that binds to nucleic acids. Proteins and polysaccharides should be in the flow-through liquid that is discarded while RNA and DNA is kept on the membrane.    
**Proteinase K**: an enzyme that cleaves the peptide bond in proteins next to the carboxyl group of hydrophobic amino acid residues. This decontaminates the sample and leaves purified DNA/RNA.

General workflow of an extraction:  
1. Cell lysis through disruption of cellular membranes  
2. Dehydration and precipitation of the cellular proteins (protein denaturation)  
3. Separation of cellular proteins and other cellular components out of the nucleic acid  
4. Precipitation and dissolving the nucleic acid  

# Quantify Results

* Today, I did the 3 larval and [2 adult samples](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-Thermal-Transplant-Porites-Trial-3/) at the same time, therefore I quantified all of the results together.

### Qubit

1 µl Reagent x 8 = 8 µl Reagent

**RNA Broad Range**

199 µl Buffer x 8 = 1592 µl Buffer

# Summary of results

* The digestion worked and produced good quantity and quality DNA and RNA from samples 713 and 505.
* For sample 546, the RNA quantity and quality was very good, however the DNA concentration was low and the DNA was very fragmented.
