**Project:** Thermal Transplant Molecular

### Goal

Re-doing ITS2 sequencing prep on *Porites astreoides* larval samples that had low quantities from the [20210302 prep](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20210302-Thermal-Transplant-ITS2/) and [20210309 prep](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20210309-Thermal-Transplant-ITS2/). The DNA from these samples were extracted with the Zymo Quick-DNA kit and Zymo DNA/RNA mini prep kit plus.

The dilution and plate planning can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PgZ8r-qgFSdBX9QOENyytBzJxyPzGEyn5nUdGs1Klrc/edit#gid=868081107)

### Protocol

I am using a modified version of [this protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-01-31-ITS2-Sequencing-Protocol.md) written by E. Strand.

The main modifications from this protocol were to adjust the dilutions for 2 replicates instead of 3 and each well had a total of 25 uL.

Additionally, I adjusted the volume of the Master Mix water to increase the input DNA amount accordingly.


#### Samples

I took the diluted samples from the dilution plate I prepped on [20210302](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20210302-Thermal-Transplant-ITS2/).

|        Sample ID        | Dilution Plate Well | Input DNA (ng) |
|:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------:|
|           B1-2          |          B1         |       0.2      |
|           C1-2          |          C1         |       0.2      |
|           E3-2          |          E3         |       0.2      |
| E9-2 (POSITIVE CONTROL) |          E9         |       0.2      |
|           B1-4          |          B1         |       0.4      |
|           C1-4          |          C1         |       0.4      |
|           E3-4          |          E3         |       0.4      |
| E9-4 (POSITIVE CONTROL) |          E9         |       0.4      |

#### Gel Results
[Gel Electrophoresis](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-16-Gel-Electrophoresis-Protocol.md)

- I ran a small 2% agarose gel of the above protocol and ran it at 100V for 60 minutes.
