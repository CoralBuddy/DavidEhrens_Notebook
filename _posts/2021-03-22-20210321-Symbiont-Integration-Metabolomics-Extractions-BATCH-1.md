**Project:** Symbiont Integration

**Metric and Protocol:** [Metabolomic extractions](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Metabolomics-P-astreoides-sample-prep/)

**Batch Number:** 1

### Goal
To prepare lab materials and process metabolomic extractions on multiple life stages of *M. capitata* samples for the Symbiont Integration experiment using the [larval protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Metabolomics-P-astreoides-sample-prep/).

### Laboratory preparation

1. Autoclaved all glass ware.
2. Wiped down all counter tops and fumehood with 10% bleach solution.
3. Obtained dry ice.
4. Took aliquots of master extraction buffer and 15% ammonium bicarbonate solutions for today's extractions.

### Samples

AH Samples that were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&deg;C.
