### Goal
To test the protocol for DNA/RNA extractions for airbrushed homogenates, larvae, and adult fragments of *Porites astreoides* for the Thermal Transplant 2017/2018 experiment.

### Samples
I used 3 adult *P. astreoides* samples that were snap frozen, then airbrushed with filtered seawater. 0.5 mL of the homogenate was aliquoted then re-frozen at -80 &deg;C. I also used 3 larval samples from 2018. 20 larvae were samples per vial. Additionally, I used 3 fragmented adult coral chips that were snap frozen, chipped, and re-frozen with 500uL of DNA/RNA shield and beads.

### Protocol description
I used a modified version of [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extraxtion-Thermal-Transplant-Porites-Homogenates/)for homogenates, [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-Thermal-Transplant-ADULT-AND-LARVAE-Trial-4/) for larvae, and [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-Thermal-Transplant-Porites-Trial-2/) for fragments.

### Homogenate preparation
1. Immediately after taking sample out of the -80&deg;C freezer, add 500&mu;L of DNA/RNA shield
2. Once fully thawed, add 100 &mu;L of Protenase K digestion buffer (Derived from volume of homogenate and 300/30 ratio from Zymo Protocol) and 50 &mu;L of Protenase K (Derived from volume of homogenate and 300/15 ratio from Zymo Protocol)
4. Vortex and spin down.
5. Incubate on Thermomixer at 56&deg;C at 1500 rpm for 30 minutes
6. Spin down for 30 seconds to pellet any debris
7. Remove 1000 &mu;L of the supernatant and transfer in 5 mL tubes. Avoid any debris.

### Larvae preparation
1. Immediately after taking sample out of the -80&deg;C freezer, add 1000&mu;L of DNA/RNA shield
2. Once fully thawed, add 100 &mu;L of Protenase K digestion buffer (Derived from volume of homogenate and 300/30 ratio from Zymo Protocol) and 50 &mu;L of Protenase K (Derived from volume of homogenate and 300/15 ratio from Zymo Protocol)
4. Vortex and spin down.
5. Incubate on Thermomixer at 56&deg;C at 1500 rpm for 90 minutes
6. Spin down for 30 seconds to pellet any debris
7. Remove 1000 &mu;L of the supernatant and transfer in 5 mL tubes. Avoid any debris.

### Fragment preparation
1. Take samples out from -80 &deg;C.
2. Add 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield to make the total volume 1 mL
3. These samples already have beads in them.
4. Vortex for 2 minutes. Leave the settings on and on max power.
5. Remove 700 μl of  the supernatant from the bead tube and place in a new 1.5 microcentrifuge tube labeled on the side with the extraction sample number and today's date. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the sample number.
6. Add 70 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 35 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to the 5 mL centrifuge tube.
7. Incubate on Thermomixer at 56&deg;C at 1500 rpm for 30 minutes
8. Spin down for 30 seconds to pellet any debris
9. Transfer 700 μl of the supernatant to a new, labelled 5 ml centrifuge tube.
10. Vortex and spin down all tubes.
