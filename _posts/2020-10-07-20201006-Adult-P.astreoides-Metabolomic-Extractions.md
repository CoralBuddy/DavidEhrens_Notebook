**Project:** [Porites Bleaching 2019](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/Porites_Rim_Bleaching_2019)

**Metric and Protocol:** [Metabolomic extractions](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Metabolomics-P-astreoides-sample-prep/)

**Batch Number:** 1

### Goal
To prepare lab materials and process metabolomic extractions on adult *Porites astreoides* samples for the Porites Bleaching 2019 experiment using [this protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Metabolomics-P-astreoides-sample-prep/).

### Laboratory preparation

1. Wiped down all counter tops and fumehood with 10% bleach solution
2. Labelled 3 sets of tubes for all of my samples (45 samples)
  * Tube labelling system:
    * #X - A = weighing vial
    * #X - B = centrifuge vial
    * #X - Extra = extra extraction vial
3. Organized freezer samples to consolidate all 45 samples into one one freezer bag
4. Printed protocols and data sheets
5. Sterilize clippers and forceps (10% bleach, DI water, ethanol)
6. Subset stock extraction buffer and ammonium bicarbonate solutions into 50mL falcon tubes
7. Fill all "A" vials with 1 mL of extraction buffer and stored in 4&deg;C fridge

### Samples

All samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&deg;C.

| Vial # 	| Fragment ID 	| Timepoint 	| Vial + Buffer (g) 	| Vial + Buffer + Coral (g) 	|
|:------:	|:-----------:	|:---------:	|:-----------------:	|:-------------------------:	|
|    1   	|      R8     	|     A1    	|       1.9745      	|           2.1527          	|
|    5   	|     R37     	|     A1    	|       1.9593      	|           2.2271          	|
|   15   	|     R36     	|     A1    	|       1.9676      	|           2.2263          	|

### Notes
* Started extraction on sample R40-A1, however the dounce was not clean when taken out of the autoclaved tinfoil (looked like residual soap). I put the extraction back in the freezer however I will re-start the extraction again for that sample.
* We have 10 dounces in total. This about the best way to maximize time with autoclaving the dounces between lab days or after 5 samples
