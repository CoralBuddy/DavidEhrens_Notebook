**Project:** Thermal Transplant Molecular

### Goal

ITS2 sequencing prep on *Porites astreoides* adult and larval samples. The DNA from these samples were extracted with the Zymo Quick-DNA kit and Zymo DNA/RNA mini prep kit plus.

The dilution and plate planning can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PgZ8r-qgFSdBX9QOENyytBzJxyPzGEyn5nUdGs1Klrc/edit#gid=868081107)

### Protocol

I am using a modified version of [this protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-01-31-ITS2-Sequencing-Protocol.md) written by E. Strand.

The main modifications from this protocol were to adjust the dilutions for 2 replicates instead of 3 and each well had a total of 25 uL.

#### Gel Results
[Gel Electrophoresis](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/100well-gel.md)

- I ran a large 100 well 2% agarose gel of the above protocol and ran it at 100V for 60 minutes.

### Notes

Generally, most of the samples worked. I will need to re-do the following wells:

A6, B1, C1, E1 (because there was final low volume), and E3.
